# mybucks.online

## Summary

This is a **password-only crypto wallet** built with [React.js](https://react.dev). It generates a private key from your password using an industry-standard, verified **one-way hash function**. Your private key forms your account, allowing you to transfer, receive, and hold your crypto assets permanently.

## How to Use

1. Visit `app.mybucks.online`
2. Input your password and confirmation
3. Click `Open`

(This process is the same for both initial opening and all subsequent uses.)

## Key Points

### Privacy Protection

- **No Registration Required:** No need for personal information, not even your email address.
- **Absolute Privacy:** Nobody knows who you are; nobody stores your password.
- **Transient Data:** Your account is generated whenever you open it. Closing or refreshing your browser erases all traces/history.
- **Share your wallet address:** its origin remains unknown.

### Security

- **One-Way Hash Function:** Utilizes [**scrypt**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt) and [**keccak256**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3). Your password determines a unique private key.
- **Resistance to Attacks:** Brute force attacks would take centuries. A strong password ensures asset protection.

### Ease of Use

- **Simple Access:** Only requires a password, no 12-word seed phrases.
- **No KYC Hassles:** No worries about KYC or suspensions.
- **Private Key Portability:** Backup your password/private key. Import into Metamask to use across DeFi products.

### Analogy

Think of it like a public locker at a railway station:

1. Find an empty box.
2. Set up your password anonymously.
3. Place your goods inside and lock.

Return later to access your goods with just your passwordâ€”no ID checks required.

That's all! ðŸŽ‰

## Generate the private key

This demonstrates how to generate a private key from your password and helps you understand the process.

```javascript
import { Buffer } from "buffer";
import { ethers } from "ethers";
import { scrypt } from "scrypt-js";

const HASH_OPTIONS = {
  N: 32768, // CPU/memory cost parameter, 2^15
  r: 8, // block size parameter
  p: 5, // parallelization parameter
  keyLen: 64,
};

async function generatePrivateKey(rawPassword) {
  // separate even, odds characters from the rawPassword
  const password = rawPassword.split().filter((, index) => index % 2 === 0).join("")
  const salt = rawPassword.split().filter((, index) => index % 2 === 1).join("")

  const passwordBuffer = Buffer.from(password);
  const saltBuffer = Buffer.from(salt);

  const hashBuffer = await scrypt(
    passwordBuffer,
    saltBuffer,
    HASH_OPTIONS.N,
    HASH_OPTIONS.r,
    HASH_OPTIONS.p,
    HASH_OPTIONS.keyLen,
    (p) => console.log(Math.floor(p * 100))
  );
  const hashHex = Buffer.from(hashBuffer).toString("hex");
  const privateKey = ethers.keccak256(abi.encode(["string"], [hashHex]));

  return privateKey;
}
```

## Transfer Ownership

You can transfer all your holdings to family or friends in a few seconds by sharing your password only.

```
mybucks.online / mYpAssword987^5
```

Send this short note to your friend in a private channel.
